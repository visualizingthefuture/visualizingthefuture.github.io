**Viz and Tell Instruction Notes and Recording**

On October 20th we had our first Viz and Tell discussion focusing on instruction hosted by Tess Grynoch and Delores Carlito. We had almost one hundred people register or join us for the event and a lively discussion about teaching data visualization both in libraries and in general. We discussed what people are teaching; what libraries specifically can add to visualization instruction; the importance of storytelling for visualization discussion; how to keep up on recent resources and information and much more. It was a great discussion and we hope many of you will be able to join us for our [November Viz and Tell](https://visualizingthefuture.github.io/2020/10/27/viz-and-tell-assessment/).

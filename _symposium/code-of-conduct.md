## About Visualizing the Future Symposia

The [Visualizing the Future Symposia](https://visualizingthefuture.github.io/) (VTF) is an IMLS National Forum Grant (RE-73-18-0059-18) to develop a literacy-based instructional and research agenda for library and information professionals with the aim to create a community of praxis focused on data visualization. This grant aims to create a diverse community that will advance data visualization instruction and use beyond hands-on, technology-based tutorials toward a nuanced, critical understanding of visualization as a research product and form of expression. 

## How to Be

Visualizing the Future is dedicated to providing a collaborative and supportive experience that is free from all forms of harassment and inclusive of all people. Small actions you can take will help us meet this goal. For instance, we suggest: 

* listening more than you speak and remembering that colleagues may have expertise you are unaware of;
* encouraging and yielding the floor to those whose viewpoints may be under-represented in a group; 
* using welcoming language, for instance by honoring pronoun preferences and favoring gender-neutral collective nouns (“people,” not “guys”); 
* accepting critique graciously and offering it constructively; 
* giving credit where it is due; 
* seeking concrete ways to make physical spaces and online resources more universally accessible; 
* and staying alert, as Active Bystanders, to the welfare of those around you.

Likewise, it is important to understand the range of behaviors that may constitute harassment. Harassment can include unwelcome or offensive verbal comments or nonverbal expressions related to: 

* age; 
* appearance or body size; 
* employment or military status; 
* ethnicity; 
* experience level;
* gender identity or expression; 
* individual lifestyles; 
* marital status; 
* national origin; 
* physical or cognitive ability; 
* political affiliation; 
* sexual orientation; 
* race; or 
* religion. 

Harassment can also include: 

* use of sexual and/or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online); 
* deliberate intimidation; 
* stalking; 
* following; 
* harassing photography or recording; 
* sustained disruption of talks or other events; 
* bullying behavior; 
* inappropriate physical contact; 
* and unwelcome sexual attention.

Sexual, discriminatory, or potentially triggering language and imagery is generally inappropriate for any Visualizing the Future event or meeting, including talks. However, this policy is not intended to constrain responsible scholarly or professional discourse and debate nor to prevent actions or activities that disrupt, undermine or otherwise challenge expressions of racism, sexism, ableism, xenophobia or other forms of discrimination or violence. We welcome engagement with difficult topics, done with respect and care.

## What to Do

That said, we will not tolerate harassment of Visualizing the Future community members in any form. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the VTF team (Justin Joque, Andy Rutkowski, and/or Angela Zoss).

To report incidents during our events, in online venues, or on-site but in the absence of a staff member, please:

* Email [visualizingthefuture at umich dot edu](mailto:visualizingthefuture@umich.edu)
* Zoom chat to a Host or Co-host (Angela, Andy, or Justin)
* Direct Message on [VTF Slack](https://vizandtell.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-letq8v1e-tiEJ_jUyCFJLGiZBGrjziA) to Angela, Andy, or Justin
* [Anonymous reporting form](https://forms.gle/RE5gsSJVFtFqJUz38)

However, if you or others are in imminent danger, please first phone emergency services at 911.

Participants at a VTF meeting or any other VTF-hosted discussion or event (held online or in person, including VTF-sponsored social events) who are asked to stop harassing or intimidating behaviors are expected to comply immediately. Those who violate our code of conduct may be warned, sanctioned, or expelled at the discretion of the organizers.

We value your presence and constructive participation in our shared community, and thank you for your attention to the comfort, safety, and well-being of fellow VTF collaborators and attendees.

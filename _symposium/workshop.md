## Description

Librarians who help learners develop skills in data visualization are often asked to teach specific tools, however, a focus on the tools may obscure the complexities of the research process and the resulting (mis)representations of data. In this workshop, participants will develop a pedagogical approach that helps them move from trainers to teachers by crafting lesson plans with learning outcomes and assessment, identifying active learning strategies, increasing comfort with classroom management, and developing reflective practice for continuous improvement of teaching. In addition, facilitators will share practical examples of embedding critical, ethics-centered data literacy into in-person and online instruction sessions.

You will leave the workshop feeling empowered as a teacher and equipped with the strategies you need to develop and teach successful data visualization workshops.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this workshop, participants will:
* Develop confidence as educators by discussing classroom management strategies and exploring teacher identity  
* Design a lesson plan with learning outcomes and assessment
* Investigate active learning strategies for developing data literacies

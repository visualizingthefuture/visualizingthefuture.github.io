title: October Viz and Tell on Data Journalism
---

The past year or so has given us amazing data journalism work that has helped to further introduce and mainstream visualization work. In the past year alone the Pulitzer prize in Public Service was won by the NY Times and the Pulitzer prize for Explanatory Journalism was won by Reuters. In each case data visualization work played an enormous role in the articles and news stories written by those organizations. In reflecting on the past year, Ben Welsh of the LA Times wrote that “Data work is now the foundation for America’s best, most ambitious and, yes, most popular journalism.” 

In light of this we wanted to devote this month's Viz and Tell to a guided discussion about how we address, acknowledge, incorporate, and otherwise work with data journalism in our teaching and learning.

title: Announcing our Ethics in Data Visualization Instruction Module
---

Back in May, we [hosted](https://visualizingthefuture.github.io/2021/04/23/viz-and-tell-ethics/) a Viz and Tell where we gave a sneak peek of our first instructional module, Ethics in Data Visualization. (See the [recording](https://umich.box.com/s/5rbtbrt48yvqh7cwm5rvcyb0dcig9674), if you missed it.) After incorporating feedback from that trial run and finalizing our materials, we're happy to share the [live instruction module](https://visualizingthefuture.github.io/ethics-in-data-viz/).

The module include slides with instructor notes and two activities, all designed to introduce basic topics around ethics in data visualization. The module can be remixed to meet a variety of different situations and audiences. For example, the instructor notes include suggestions for alternative examples that may be more interesting to certain groups, and the activities can be adapted to different amounts of time and different teaching settings. 

Feel free to download the [Ethics in Data Visualization instruction module](https://visualizingthefuture.github.io/ethics-in-data-viz/) and incorporate it into your work. Please let us know if you have any questions or suggestions by [adding issues](https://github.com/visualizingthefuture/ethics-in-data-viz/issues) to the GitHub repository.

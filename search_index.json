["roadmap.html", "2 Roadmap 2.1 Find your people. Make connections. 2.2 Skill up", " 2 Roadmap If you've just been hired as a data librarian, finding your way doesn't need to be a struggle. Here is a roadmap for your first months. 2.1 Find your people. Make connections. Who are the people in your organization who are working with data? Talk to them! Who was doing dataviz-related work before you got there? It may not have been officially part of their position, but talk to them! Was your position created because of the needs/requests of certain communities or people? Talk to them! Additional offices and groups to seek connection: Grants/funding offices Digital humanities/scholarship centers Particular disciplines (sciences/social sciences/stats, etc) Subject Librarians / Liaison librarians Local government Talk to the people who you found. Invite them to talk about their needs and the gaps they see in support AND the things that the library has already been helping with. If you're not in a primarily public-facing position, find opportunities to shadow librarians who are (in instruction, on the reference/public service desk/etc) Find your community beyond your institution Subscribe to listservs Go to public lectures/talks/etc If funding is available, attend conferences. Find other online communities (Data Librarians on Facebook; datacure; Twitter; etc) Find community groups who might be working with data beyond your institution 2.2 Skill up Read articles from our Resources section Look through the curated training materials and use the ones that make the most sense for your position Watch for webinars/other online trainings on the listservs you subscribe to Find your community beyond your institution Subscribe to listservs Go to public lectures/talks/etc If funding is available, attend conferences.

In this data era, increasingly you will find data allies in unconventional places. 3.2 Other directories &amp; communities If you want to look beyond your organization for peers, you might try to use a federated directory search and other networking tools. Here are a few federated directories and communities to explore. Table 3.1: Places to find external community. name about IASSIST From the site: “IASSIST is an international organization of professionals working in and with information technology and data services to support research and teaching in the social sciences. Its members are from a variety of workplaces, including data archives, statistical agencies, research centers, libraries, academic departments, government departments, and non-profit organizations.” Code4Lib From ‘About’: “code4lib isn’t entirely about code or libraries. It is a volunteer-driven collective of hackers, designers, architects, curators, catalogers, artists and instigators from around the world, who largely work for and with libraries, archives and museums on technology “stuff.” It started in the fall of 2003 as a mailing list when a group of library programmers decided to create an overarching community agnostic towards any particular language or technology.” R4DS/TidyTuesday A loose, yet supportive nework of people interested in use of R language for data science. Direct2Experts Consider searching for data librarians and other experts at nearby institions. Direct2Experts is a federated staff directory search across many academic and other institutions. You can search for keywords or specific job titles. Results are grouped by institution. ORCID From the advanced search page, you can search for individuals by the keywords mapped to their Orcid profile. (Example keyword search: “Research Data Management”) ALA ALA has multiple, projects, programs and traingings where you may meet and build community with fellow data librarians. 3.3 Conferences Conferences are a great place to build your network. Try to be as social as you can. Go to postering sessions. Ask questions. Strike up conversations. Here are some conferences you might want to consider attending. Table 3.2: Useful conferences for data librarians. Name about csv,conf “Featuring stories about data sharing and data analysis from science, journalism, government, and open source.” RDAP Summit The RDAP summit is “ relevant to the interests and needs of data managers and curators, librarians who work with research data, and researchers and data scientists.” Code4Lib Library conference focused on technology, often with data sessions covering topics such as natural language processing, research data management, and more. Midwest Data Librarian Symposium Academic data librarian unconference covering topics such as RDM, curating code, and more. IASSIST Conference IASSIST describes itself as “an international organization of professionals working with information technology and data services to support research and teaching in the social sciences.” Research Data Alliance Research Data Alliance “provides a neutral space where its members can come together to develop and adopt infrastructure that promotes data-sharing and data-driven research” Library Assessment Conference A library conference of &quot;practitioners and researchers who have responsibility or interest in the broad field of library assessment&quot;.

Semiology of Graphics: Diagrams, Networks, Maps (1 edition). Redlands, Calif.: Esri Press. Seminal work on princliples of graphical representation. An early attempt at a standardized set of rules for graphical representation, drawing from the worlds of grammar and topography.

Burlingame, Calif.: Analytics Press. Covers visual represenation of tables and graphs for effective communicaiton. Extremely practical and approachable, particularly suitable for those interested in business and community usage of data visualizations. Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction (Healy) This book covers both the 'why' and the 'how' of data visualization using the R programming language and the ggplot2 visualization library.

Drucker, J. (2011). Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display. 5(1). An argument for the development of visualization methods more fitting for humanities work, taking into account the co-dependent nature of observer and experience in humanities research, as well as the interpretative nature of this research. Data Visualization Literacy: Investigating Data Interpretation Along the Novice—Expert Continuum. (n.d.). 8. Presents results of a data literacy study meant to understand how expertise develops in this domain. While studies have been done on the development of reading and writing skills among students, this study seeks to fill the gap around reading and creating data visualizations. Implications for instruction are also discussed. Nolan, D., &amp; Perrett, J. (2015). Teaching and Learning Data Visualization: Ideas and Assignments. ArXiv:1503.00781 [Stat]. Calls for the early integration of data visualization activities into other disaplines, and provides assignment and exercise ideas.

Journal of Statistical Software, 59(1), 1–23. Discusses key role of data and processes for cleaning ahead of data visualization. Presents a framework that can be applied for efficiency and consistency in data cleaning work. While this article is intimately connected to the tidyverse group of packages in R (created in part by the author, Wickham), these principles can be applied in a variety of settings. Borkin, M., Vo, A., Bylinskii, Z., Isola, P., Sunkavalli, S., Oliva, A., … others. (2013). What makes a visualization memorable?

Finding include both the intuitive (color and &quot;human-recognizable objects&quot; increase memorability) and non-intuitive (unique visualization types are more memorable than common types). Braun, S. (2019). Critically engaging with data visualization through an information literacy framework. Digital Humanities Quarterly, 012(4). Explores an approach to critical data literacy that builds on common information literacy practices, such as critical engagement with the raw materials (raw data), the tools used to build visualizations, and the end-products (visualizations) of this process.

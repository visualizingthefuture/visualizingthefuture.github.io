title: Notes from March Viz and Tell Show and Tell
---

Our March Viz and Tell had 34 registrants and 26 participants. 

Thank you to everyone who could attend and a huge thank you to Emma Slayton and Matthew Sisk for sharing their visualization projects with us. 
Our [live notes document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3ENqu8xn9I-SM7sqsP4s-vIqknnd4UqN0jk_r7_Ki0/edit?usp=sharing) has been updated with resources and observations that participants shared. The document is open to comments so please feel free to share more resources etc. and we will update this accordingly. [The recording](https://youtu.be/b2CUU05uyL4) is also available.
Our conversation began with Emma and Mattâ€™s presentations and questions and comments about their work. 
This was such a great conversation! Thank you to all that could participate. We are continuing some of these conversations actively in our Slack Channels so please check this out as you wait for our next Viz and Tell.
